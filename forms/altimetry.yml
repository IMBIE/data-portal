    questions:
      - index: 1a
        prompt: "Time-series of mass change, mass change uncertainty, and of observed area:"
        type: checkbox
        options:
          - East Antarctic Ice Sheet
          - West Antarctic Ice Sheet
          - Antartic Peninsula Ice Sheet
          - Greenland Ice Sheet
      - index: 1b
        prompt: Upload a single, concatenated, time-series data file, following
         the IMBIE standard file format. Please do not apply any temporal smoothing
         to your data, other than that required as part of your basic retrieval.
        type: upload
      - index: 2a
        prompt: Rates of mass change and their uncertainties, and the observed areas
        and time intervals over which these are calculated. *Remember that these data
        will form the basis of our mass balance aggregation, and so you should supply
        estimates for each region over as many time intervals as your method allows
        with confidence.*
